# EndPlusPlus Mod for Mc 1.19.4 

EndPlusPlus adds new content to vanilla end dimension like end-exclusive resources, new higher tier of tools and new crafting recepies.

Mod was made to feel like "A Vanilla-like End Update" that stays in spirit of vanilla minecraft but adds new content to boring end dimension!

This project also is made for fun to try Minecraft Modding and Java Programming language so I will not guarantee any updates for this mod.




## Dependencies

To use this mod you need to install a Fabric Loader and Fabric API for Minecraf 1.19.4 which you can find on this websites:
https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/ - Fabric Loader
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api - Fabric API

Basic install of Fabric with Fabric API is straight forward and if you have your monitor turned on, you will get this no problem!

## Installation
Just put .jar file into your *mods* folder and it should work fine

Mod also should work with other mods as long as they're not modifing end dimension!


## Crafting  and Smelting 
All recipes for new tools blocks and other stuff that my mod adds!

To get a "Enderium Dust" you need to mine a "Source of Enderium" that is generated in End Dimension and you can only mine it with Netherite Pickaxe!

Also Mod adds new Trees called "Anti Matter Trees" that are generated in end dimension and they have their crafting recepies!

Most of them are really "intuitive" but the weird one is:

Sapling of Anti Matter

This is the only way to get saplings of "Anti Matter Tree"!

Yeah I know is not vanilla in any way but I thinks it's cool that you can craft a Sapling from Leave Blocks :)

To obtain "Anti Matter Leaves" you need to use some tool with  
"Silk Touch" enchantment!
